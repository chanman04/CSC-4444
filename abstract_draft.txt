Dreaming was considered a supernatural communication or a means of divine intervention, whose message could be unravelled by 
people with certain powers. Our project will focus on dream interpretation and display it via Android Apps. Starting with 400 dreaming
terms, such as ocean, dark, death, accident, etc, we create interpretation for each term which was obtained from dream dictionary. 
With IBM Watson system, we uploaded dream documents, including both terms and interpretation answers into corpus. With IBM Watson 
learning process, we can get 400 Q&A pairs for each dream term. For example, if you ask "what's meaning if I dreamt of walking alone
at dark", through IBM Watson, you can get several answers in different correlation levels. Especially, the top answer is 
the one highly correlated with your question. 

In addition, the platform applied for users is Android Apps. Android provides app framework (Android Studio) that allows developers to provide unique resources
for different device configurations. Here, we mainly use XML and JavaScript for Android programming. The connection between IBM Watson 
and Android Apps is rest API which can be reached from IBM Bluemix. When users asked questions with Android device, through rest API, the question documents will 
be delivered to IBM Watson system. Meanwhile, after IBM Watson Q&A process is done, then transfer answers back to users' Android device
via rest API again. For example, when a user ask "I dreamt an accident last night, what does this mean?", jason file will be deliver to 
IBM Waston corpus, after interpretation, deliver answer to the user's Android device and show up on the interface. 

Our project is robust since dream interpretation is closely correlated to people's life. With our Dream Catcher App, it would be a 
great help for people's life.
